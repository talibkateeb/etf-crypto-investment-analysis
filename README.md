# ETF and Crypto Investment Analyzer

A Python / Jupyter Lab analysis comparing traditional investments (Exchange Trade Funds, Mutual Funds) to the new, developing investment vehicle, cryptocurrency.

This comparison allows for users to determine how they would like to customize their investment portfolio on the basis of a few simple questions:

* Available funds for investment

* Risk tolerance

* Personal preference (allowing for the selection of the different investments available)

* (placeholder)

The end result is a series of visuals demonstrating varying projected profits, depending on the answers submitted in the questionaire.
