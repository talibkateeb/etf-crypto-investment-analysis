# Crypto Trading Strategies: Advanced
QuantInsti

In this course, you have learned how to code the clustering strategy for cryptocurrency, pairs trading strategy, crypto trading strategy using the Hurst exponent and long-only momentum strategy in Python.
This readme file has the following sections:
1. Prerequisites
2. Installing packages
3. Running the code
4. Folder structure
5. Authors
## Prerequisites:
Before running these notebooks, you need to set up a Python environment on your local machine. If already present, make sure the Python version is 3.6.1. To change the Python version, open the Anaconda prompt and type the following command:\
`conda install python=3.9.1`
## Installing packages:
We have used the following Python libraries in the course. Kindly ensure you have these libraries installed with the same versions as mentioned below. To install the same version on your local system, type these commands on Jupyter notebook.\
`!pip install numpy == 1.20.1`\
`!pip install pandas == 1.2.3`\
`!pip install matplotlib == 3.3.4`\
`!pip install TA-Lib == 0.4.19`\
`!pip install scikit-learn == 0.24.1`\
`!pip install seaborn == 0.11.1`\
`!pip install statsmodels == 0.12.2`\
`!pip install hurst == 0.0.5`
## Running the code:
Once you have your system in place, you can run the notebooks using Jupyter interface. This is installed along with Anaconda.
## Folder structure:
Folder contains four subfolders divided based on the course sections and one data folder that stores the data required to run them.
